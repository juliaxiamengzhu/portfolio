				<h3>I'm an aspiring UI Designer who grows bacteria by day...and then kill them with high pressure steam</h3>
				<p>Though I've always had an artistic streak, I majored in a food science degree where I learned a bit of of everything except for the arts. I currently work as a microbiologist in a manufacturing plant.</p>

				<p>I wasn't just exposed to bacteria. I also witnessed how the elderly interact with technology. A task as simple as copying an Excel cell could distress them. This in turn help me empathize with the people who are left behind by technological advances.</p>

				<p>I've also seen bad UX/UI designs, from testing labs' web pages to scientific software. Scientific software pose a unique challenge in that <a href = "https://www.ddw-online.com/informatics/p320374-ux-design-maximising-the-value-of-scientific-software-in-life-science-r&d.html"> designers often don't have the background to understand scientists' needs.</a> How can we expect otherwise experienced scientists to navigate through cumbersome menus if even younger scientists struggle with them?</p>

				<p>Rather than be stuck with bad UI designs, I decided to embrace my artistic streak and pursue a designer career. Whatever I design, I keep in mind my experiences with coworkers struggling with bad UI, because everyone deserves a good user experience through good user interface.</p>
